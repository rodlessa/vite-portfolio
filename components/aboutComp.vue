<p>My name is Rod Lessa, and I hold a degree in Game Design. Over the course of my career, I transitioned from support and infrastructure roles to web application development and DevOps.</p>

<p>In 2023, I pursued my passion for cloud technologies, particularly in deploying and managing infrastructure, which led me to earn the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification. Currently, I work in the pharmaceutical industry as a System Administrator and Database Administrator (DBA), where I manage and optimize critical IT systems and infrastructure.
